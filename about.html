          September '21: Created an issue searcher for Github which is available to view on my Github profile, for this I used PyGithub. I also made a Bluetooth app which was pretty hard to make using Pybluez and Pydbus, both of which had poor documentation. Also made some open source contributions in Python.

          Track Record of Learning Quickly
        </p>
        <p>
              In my final year at university (2017) for my dissertation project, within six months I learnt to code in an abstract language called Cg (this stands for C for graphics programming) in Unity. Created a shader which built up snow over time in a 3D scene and tracked imprints.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the University module, Commercial Games Development, learnt to create four games, each of which had to be learnt in 48 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within 72 hours created a game in Unity called ‘Running Late Larry’ as a team of four developers. (Link available on the home page).
            </p>
          
            </p>
            <p>
          IT Key Achievements
          <p>
              Within a Windows environment was introduced to programming through creating a Hello World program using a text file and the terminal in Windows. At college I programmed in Pascal whilst using the development environment Delphi, again within a Windows environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my time at Friarsgate Practice, in 2018 used Windows 7 to introduce a new system called Google Sheets and then trained two colleagues in how to use it. Involved persuading the Office Supervisor to take this action.         
            </p> 
            </p>
            <p>
              <p>
          Other Key Achievements
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2018 at the Cart & Horses in Kings Worthy, solved the problem of the freezer door not closing properly by a clever use of wooden chip forks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, at the same establishment took initiatives to improve the service we provided, e.g. changing how dishes were presented.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have previously been a part of the leadership team for a church 14 to18-year-old youth group; involved leading discussion groups, creating and organising games, and occasionally providing food.</p>
